In the beginning there is infinite possibility. We all begin in darkness; without light there is no time, only waiting.

Passenger
An Interactive Fiction by Erin Hoffman-John
Release 1 / Serial number 160423 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Emptiness
A vast darkness extends in all directions. Distantly, blurry motes of light seem to float on the horizon -- or it might be a trick of your eyes. 

 There are no obvious exits.

You can see a glowing portal here.
